# Rulin' the Booleans

### Workflow

Just your typical pull, copy, and create a repo... and run the tests kind of exercise! Remember to use good naming conventions for your parameters/variables!


### Tasks

* Write a function called `moreThan5` that takes in a number and returns whether or not it's greater than `5`.
* Write a function called `isNewTopScore` that takes in a score (as a number) and a top score (as a number) and returns whether or not the score is greater than the top score. (This would be a good function in a game or gamified app to see if we need to update the high score to a new one.)
* Write a function called `isInDanger` that takes in a grade (as a number) and returns whether or not it's between `60` and `71`, _inclusive_.
* Write a function called `isCoasting` that takes in a grade (as a number) and returns whether or not it's between `72` and `83`, _inclusive_.
* Write a function called `isSucceeding` that takes in a grade (as a number) and returns whether or not its between `84` and `92`, _inclusive_.
* Write a function called `isFailing` that takes in a grade (as a number) and returns whether or not it's below `60`.
* Write a function called `isAcing` that takes in a grade (as a number) and returns whether or not it's above `92`.
* Write a function called `isStudent` that takes in a role (as a string) and returns if its value is "student".
* Write a function called `isTeacher` that takes in a role (as a string) and returns if its value is "teacher".
* Write a function called `isAdmin` that takes in a role (as a string) and returns if its value is "admin".
* Write a function called `isElementary` that takes in school level (as a string) and returns if its value is "elementary".
* Write a function called `areDifferentPeople` that takes in two names (as strings) and returns whether they're different.
* Write a function called `isMiddleSchoolTeacher` that takes in a role (as a string) and a level (as a _number_) and returns whether they're both a teacher and the level they teach at is `6` to `8` _inclusive_.
* Write a function called `notAnElementarySchoolAdministrator` that takes in a school level (as a string) and a role (as a string) and returns whether they're NOT an elementary school administrator. (An elementary school teacher is not, nor is a middle school administrator. )
